#About ExtraCarbon
ExtraCarbon is simple & efficient platform that allow you to recycle your waste & sell your product responsibly. It is also a place to learn & inoculated habits that have direct impact on you and your community. 

We started ExtraCarbon because we saw a need for a unifying platform where members of any local community can exercise responsibility in getting rid of stuff from their houses. ExtraCarbon band together your local wise collectors or 'Kabadiwalas', and organizes them to make - collection fast easy & honest. 
You can use ExtraCarbon to arrange pick-ups from your house,buy or sell second hand items, and learn how to better go green.
